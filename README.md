# About Cookie Hero
Cookie Hero is a simple game I've been working on in Unity to practice game development. Playing as Cookie Hero, a cookie-loving 
fine young man, you'll try to eat cookies that fall from the sky while dodging trash thrown by the vile, cookie-hating Stinkus. 
The goal is to reach the highest score you can before loosing all your lives to Stinkus' trash. 

# How to Play
**The Basics** </br>
Cookie Hero can move to the left or right on the screen to grab cookies or avoid trash. When Cookie Hero eats a cookie, the 
cookie counter (your score) will increase. If Cookie Hero gets hit by trash he will lose one of his three lives. Fortunately, 
Cookie Hero can get more lives at certain cookie thresholds that increase as the game progresses. 

**Trash Time** </br>
Every once in a while, Stinkus will announce the start of Trash Time. During Trash Time, only trash will fall from the sky, with
no cookies in sight until it ends. Trash time will end after a certain amount of time passes, lasting longer on higher cookie counts.

**Bonus Round** </br>
Although trash time is dangerous, it presents the opportunity to enter the bonus round, where you can earn up to 100 cookies with
enough skill. In order to trigger the bonus round, you'll have to dodge every piece of trash during trash time, meaning you can't
lose a single heart. In the bonus round, you'll collect candy cookies that have the added bonus of giving Cookie Hero an automatic 
dash that will last as long as you continue to grab candy cookies consecutively. The candy cookies fall in batches of 10, with a 
total of 5 batches. If you manage to nab all 10 cookies in a batch, the next batch will come- but at a faster speed. At the end 
of a bonus round, a bonus candy cookie will fall from the sky, its size depending on how many cookies were successfully collected 
in the bonus round. At the largest size, the bonus candy cookie is worth 50 cookies!

but was one cookie short of triggering the next batch.
